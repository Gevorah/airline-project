# airline-project
is an airline simulator program that is in charge of asking users
your departure and arrival destinations and if you want to get the route or the cost and
at the same time allows you to select the type of graph you want to use since you will find
implemented two types, adjacency list and adjacency matrix. Once
obtained this information, the program calculates the most efficient route and gives you
the user the chosen information.
